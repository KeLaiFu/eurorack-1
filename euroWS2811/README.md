Simple WS2811 setup with brightness and hue controlled by CV input, using a Teensy 3.6 in this example. Don't forget to connect ground on the LED strip to ground ont the power supply as well as ground on the Teensy. A 1000uF 16v capacitor across the power supply is also required. Add dividers or opamps with offset and division to control the CV input signals if required.
